## KICKSTARTER
The project is similar to the idea what kickstarter proposes, but here the campaigner along with their project/campaign details have to create the Spending Request in order to spend some money. The reason for that spending and the address to whom it would be paid also has to be mentioned. Request can be approved and disapproved by the investors of those campaigns. If requests gets more than 50% approvals, then the amount mentioned is transferred to the address automatically through the smart contract to the address mentioned in that request.
Thus, by involving the blockchain in this idea, it has made it more secure from frauds.
